# Comparison with Other TCGs

The Hololive Official Card Game shares similarities with several popular trading card games, while also introducing unique mechanics that set it apart. Here's a comparison with some of the most well-known TCGs:

## Weiß Schwarz
- **Deck Size**: Both Hololive TCG and Weiß Schwarz require a 50-card deck, promoting a balance between consistency and variety.
- **Climax Cards vs. Cheer Cards**: In Weiß Schwarz, Climax Cards can dramatically change the outcome of a game by providing powerful effects and canceling damage. In contrast, Hololive TCG's Cheer Cards offer a unique support mechanism, enhancing your Holomen's abilities during the Cheer Step, and adding a strategic layer to each turn.

## Yu-Gi-Oh!
- **Life Points**: The Hololive TCG uses a more traditional life point system, similar to many TCGs, including Yu-Gi-Oh!. Players aim to reduce their opponent's Life Points to zero to win the game. While Yu-Gi-Oh! also uses Life Points, the mechanics and strategies around how damage is dealt and prevented differ between the games.
- **Turn Phases**: Both games feature a structured turn sequence, emphasizing strategic decision-making at each phase. However, Hololive TCG introduces unique phases like the Cheer Step, which doesn't have a direct counterpart in Yu-Gi-Oh!.

## Magic: The Gathering
- **Untap/Reset Step**: The Reset Step in the Hololive TCG is similar to Magic: The Gathering's Untap Step. In this phase, players prepare their Holomen for the next turn by reactivating any that were used (rested) in the previous turn. This mechanic ensures that all cards are ready for action at the start of each turn, similar to how MTG handles card readiness.
