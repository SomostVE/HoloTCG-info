# Card Types

The Hololive Official Card Game features several types of cards, each playing a crucial role in building your strategy and leading your Holomen to victory. Below is an overview of the different card types and their functions.

## Oshi Holomen Card
- **Unique Role**: The Oshi Holomen Card is the heart of your deck, representing your primary character. You can only have one Oshi Holomen Card in your deck.
- **Special Abilities**: This card features unique "Oshi Skills" and a powerful "SP Oshi Skill" that can be used only once per game. These abilities can dramatically influence the game, so using them wisely is key to success.
- **Placement**: The Oshi Holomen Card is placed in the Oshi Position on the field, where it remains throughout the game, guiding your strategy and supporting your other Holomen.

## Holomen Cards
- **Main Characters**: These are the primary cards that make up your team. Each Holomen Card has distinct stats and abilities, allowing for a variety of strategies and combinations.
- **Performing Arts**: Holomen Cards can perform "Arts" during the Performance Step, which are actions that include attacking, using abilities, or supporting other Holomen.
- **Versatility**: With different combinations of stats and skills, Holomen Cards can be used flexibly depending on your deck's strategy and the specific game situation.

## Cheer Cards
- **Boosting Abilities**: Drawn during the Cheer Step, Cheer Cards provide a temporary boost to your Holomen, enhancing their abilities or granting special effects for that turn.
- **Strategic Play**: The strategic use of Cheer Cards can turn the tide of battle, especially when used in combination with your Oshi Holomen's abilities.
- **Unique Mechanic**: Cheer Cards are unique to the Hololive TCG, adding an extra layer of strategy and interaction each turn.

## Support Cards
- **Aid and Enhancement**: Support Cards offer various effects to assist your Holomen during the Main Step. These effects can range from enhancing a Holomenâ€™s stats to providing other tactical advantages.
- **Single Use**: Typically, Support Cards are played from your hand and are used once during your turn. After use, they are sent to the Archive, similar to a discard pile.
- **Critical Timing**: Knowing when to play a Support Card is crucial, as they can provide the necessary boost to secure a win or defend against an opponent's strategy.
