# Advanced Strategies

Once you’ve mastered the basics of the Hololive Official Card Game, it’s time to dive into advanced strategies that can give you the edge over your opponents. Here are some tactics to consider:

## 1. Timing Your Cheer Cards
The timing of when you play Cheer Cards can be crucial. Holding onto a powerful Cheer Card until the right moment can surprise your opponent and secure victory. Consider the flow of the game and when your opponent is most vulnerable.

## 2. Controlling the Board
Maintaining control of the battlefield is key to winning the game. Focus on removing your opponent’s key Holomen while protecting your own. Cards that disrupt your opponent’s strategy or remove threats are invaluable.

## 3. Synergizing Abilities
Look for synergies between your Holomen and Support Cards. Some abilities are designed to work together, creating powerful combinations that can overwhelm your opponent. Experiment with different pairings to find what works best.

## 4. Playing Mind Games
Bluffing and psychological tactics can play a role in your success. Sometimes, the mere threat of a powerful card can force your opponent to play defensively. Use this to your advantage by keeping your opponent guessing.

## 5. Adapting to Your Opponent
Every opponent is different, and a strategy that works well against one deck might not be as effective against another. Be prepared to adapt your strategy based on what your opponent is playing. Flexibility is key to long-term success.
