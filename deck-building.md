# Deck Building Tips

Building a strong deck in the Hololive Official Card Game requires careful consideration of the cards you choose and how they synergize with your overall strategy. Here are some tips to help you build a winning deck:

## 1. Focus on Your Oshi Holomen
Your Oshi Holomen is the centerpiece of your deck. Choose one that complements your playstyle, whether it’s aggressive, defensive, or control-oriented. Build your deck around maximizing the strengths of your Oshi Holomen.

## 2. Balance Holomen and Support Cards
While your Holomen will do most of the work on the battlefield, Support Cards can provide crucial boosts and strategic advantages. A good balance between Holomen and Support Cards ensures that you’re never caught off guard.

## 3. Include a Variety of Cheer Cards
Cheer Cards can turn the tide of battle by enhancing your Holomen’s abilities. Including a variety of Cheer Cards in your deck ensures that you have options for different situations.

## 4. Keep an Eye on Your Mana Curve
Make sure your deck has a good distribution of cards that can be played at various stages of the game. Having a mix of low-cost and high-cost cards ensures that you’re always able to play something, regardless of your current resources.

## 5. Playtest and Refine
Building a deck is an iterative process. Playtest your deck against different opponents and refine it based on what works and what doesn’t. Sometimes, even a small tweak can make a big difference.
