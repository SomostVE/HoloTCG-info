# Turn Structure

Understanding the turn structure in the Hololive Official Card Game is crucial for mastering gameplay. Each turn is divided into several key steps, each with specific actions that can be performed. Here's a breakdown of each step:

## Reset Step
- **Objective**: Prepare your Holomen for the new turn.
- **Actions**:
  - Reactivate all your resting Holomen by turning them back to their vertical position (similar to "untapping" in Magic: The Gathering). This makes them ready to act during your turn.
  - Any effects that trigger at the start of your turn will also be resolved during this step.
  
**Strategic Tip**: Properly managing which Holomen you allow to rest during your turn can set you up for powerful plays in the following turns.

## Draw Step
- **Objective**: Replenish your hand with new resources.
- **Actions**:
  - Draw one card from the top of your deck and add it to your hand.
  - If your deck is empty and you cannot draw a card, you lose the game (deck-out condition).

**Strategic Tip**: Always consider the cards remaining in your deck. Drawing a crucial card at the right moment can turn the tide of the game.

## Cheer Step
- **Objective**: Boost your Holomen’s abilities.
- **Actions**:
  - Draw a Cheer Card from your Cheer Deck.
  - Assign the Cheer Card to one of your active Holomen on the field. The Cheer Card may provide stat boosts, special abilities, or other enhancements that last for the duration of the turn.

**Strategic Tip**: Carefully choose which Holomen receives the Cheer Card based on your current strategy and the state of the game. A well-timed boost can be the difference between victory and defeat.

## Main Step
- **Objective**: Set up your strategy for the turn.
- **Actions**:
  - **Play Holomen Cards**: You can summon new Holomen from your hand to the battlefield, placing them in the appropriate positions (Center, Back, or Collab).
  - **Play Support Cards**: Use Support Cards from your hand to assist your Holomen, alter the game state, or hinder your opponent. These effects can range from direct stat enhancements to more complex strategies.
  - **Arrange Your Field**: Position your Holomen strategically. Decide which will be in the front lines and which will take supportive roles.

**Strategic Tip**: Think ahead and plan your Main Step actions to maximize the effectiveness of your Performance Step. The way you arrange your Holomen can significantly impact the outcome of the battle.

## Performance Step
- **Objective**: Engage in combat and activate abilities.
- **Actions**:
  - **Perform Arts**: During this step, your Holomen can use their unique "Arts" to attack your opponent's Holomen or activate special abilities.
  - **Resolve Battles**: If you initiate an attack, compare the stats of the attacking Holomen with the defending Holomen. The outcome is determined by these stats, and the losing Holomen may be defeated and removed from the field.
  - **Activate Abilities**: Some Holomen or Support Cards may have abilities that trigger during this step, providing additional effects such as healing, extra attacks, or disrupting your opponent's plans.

**Strategic Tip**: Timing is crucial in the Performance Step. Know when to launch an all-out attack and when to hold back and prepare for a counterattack in future turns.

## End Step
- **Objective**: Conclude your turn and prepare for your opponent’s response.
- **Actions**:
  - Resolve any end-of-turn effects that may be active.
  - Declare the end of your turn, passing play to your opponent.

**Strategic Tip**: Before ending your turn, ensure that your defenses are solid. Consider the potential threats your opponent may pose during their turn and position your Holomen accordingly.
