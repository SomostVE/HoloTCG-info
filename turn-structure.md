# Turn Structure

Understanding the turn structure in the Hololive Official Card Game is crucial for mastering gameplay. Each turn is divided into several key steps, each with specific actions that can be performed. Here's a breakdown of each step:

## Reset Step
- **Objective**: Prepare your Holomen for the new turn.
- **Actions**:
  - Reactivate all your resting Holomen by turning them back to their vertical position (similar to "untapping" in Magic: The Gathering). This makes them ready to act during your turn.
  - Any effects that trigger at the start of your turn will also be resolved during this step.

## Draw Step
- **Objective**: Replenish your hand with new resources.
- **Actions**:
  - Draw one card from the top of your deck and add it to your hand.
  - If your deck is empty and you cannot draw a card, you lose the game (deck-out condition).

## Cheer Step
- **Objective**: Boost your Holomen’s abilities.
- **Actions**:
  - Draw a Cheer Card from your Cheer Deck.
  - Assign the Cheer Card to one of your active Holomen on the field. The Cheer Card may provide stat boosts, special abilities, or other enhancements that last for the duration of the turn.

## Main Step
- **Objective**: Set up your strategy for the turn.
- **Actions**:
  - **Play Holomen Cards**: You can summon new Holomen from your hand to the battlefield, placing them in the appropriate positions (Center, Back, or Collab).
  - **Play Support Cards**: Use Support Cards from your hand to assist your Holomen, alter the game state, or hinder your opponent. These effects can range from direct stat enhancements to more complex strategies.
  - **Arrange Your Field**: Position your Holomen strategically. Decide which will be in the front lines and which will take supportive roles.

## Performance Step
- **Objective**: Engage in combat and activate abilities.
- **Actions**:
  - **Perform Arts**: During this step, your Holomen can use their unique "Arts" to attack your opponent's Holomen or activate special abilities.
  - **Resolve Battles**: If you initiate an attack, compare the stats of the attacking Holomen with the defending Holomen. The outcome is determined by these stats, and the losing Holomen may be defeated and removed from the field.
  - **Activate Abilities**: Some Holomen or Support Cards may have abilities that trigger during this step, providing additional effects such as healing, extra attacks, or disrupting your opponent's plans.

## End Step
- **Objective**: Conclude your turn and prepare for your opponent’s response.
- **Actions**:
  - Resolve any end-of-turn effects that may be active.
  - Declare the end of your turn, passing play to your opponent.
